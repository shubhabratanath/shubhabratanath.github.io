<h2 id="micro-services-placement-fog">Micro-services Placement in Fog Computing</h2>

<div class="b">Fog computing can perform in-network processing using the residual resources of the network equipment like the routers. As the fog nodes are resource constrained, the fog services need to adopt micro-service architecture. In the micro-service architecture, each application is developed in the form of a collection of loosely coupled lightweight services.</div>

<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>

<h3 id="place-the-micro-services-in-fog-devices-so-that-the-maximum-response-time-taken-by-the-applications-is-minimized.">Place the micro-services in fog devices so that the maximum response time taken by the applications is minimized.</h3>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<div class="b">The primary challenges of micro-service placement in fog computing are as follows:</div>
<ul>
  <li><div class="b">As the fog uses in-network processing, all the fog devices have their primary workloads (e.g., routing for a network router), and the fog resource availability varies over time. Further, the secondary workload from the micro-services should not interfere with the primary workload of the fog devices.</div></li>
  <li><div class="b">Multiple micro-services can be placed simultaneously at the fog devices; therefore, the architecture requires micro-service isolation to ensure resource provisioning.</div></li>
  <li><div class="b">Based on the temporal nature of the primary workload, the architecture must support seamless migration of micro-services from one fog device to another to ensure application QoS.</div></li>
  <li><div class="b">The deployment framework and the micro-service migration framework must be lightweight so that
it can cater to low latency IoT applications by deciding micro-service placement quickly.</div></li>
  <li><div class="b">The highly dynamic nature of the in-network processing architecture increases monitoring overhead, and maintaining consistency of the monitored statistics is difficult. The monitoring inconsistency leads to
the performance degradation of the overall system.</div></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
<h3 id="micro-service-placement-using-bayesian-optimization-ptc">Micro-service Placement using Bayesian Optimization : PTC </h3>
<div class="b">PTC framework places the micro-services in the fog devices based on bayesian optimization which is an iterative reinforcement learning algorithm.</div>
<div class="b">PTC can also perform migration of the micro-services from one fog device to another fog device dynamically.</div>  
<div class="b">We implemented the system using Raspberry Pi 3 model b single-board computers as the fog devices, connected over a local network. In the
fog devices, we use Docker to achieve micro-service isolation. Docker provides a platform for lightweight containers by application layer virtualization. </div>  
<div class="b">The results show that the PTC framework learns the fog environment using bayesian optimization and can take action accordingly to provide a minimum average response time for running the applications. The system has an overhead in terms of the resource usage of the fog devices and fog controller device. </div>
<div class="b">We have also implemented PTC in iFogSim in order to check the scalability of the proposed framework with an increased numbers of fog devices. </div>
